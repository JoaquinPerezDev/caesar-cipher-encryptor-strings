Given a non-empty string of lowercase letters and a non-negative integer 
representing a key, write a funciton that returns a new string obtained 
by shifting every letter in the input string by k positions in the alphabet, 
where k is the key.

Not that letters should "wrap" around the alphabet; in other words, the 
letter z shifted by one returns the letter a.

Sample input: string = "xyz" <br>
                key = 2 <br>
Sample output:         "zab"
